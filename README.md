Problem

Traditional carbon markets suffer from:

Transfer – Credits can be traded between participants in a peer-to-peer fashion.

Retirement – Participants permanently retire credits to offset carbon emissions.

Tracking – All issuance, transfers, and retirements are stored on-chain and auditable.

Transfer Mechanism – Credits can be transferred between users.

Retirement Functionality – Retired credits are removed from circulation.

Transparency – Events logged for every action for easy auditing.

Open Access – Individuals, organizations, and DAOs can participate.
